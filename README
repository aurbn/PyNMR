Attempt to add NMR abilities to molecular viewer Pymol, including :
- Display distance constraints as sticks between atoms / group of atoms with color code
- Display distance constraint density as a color gradient on the molecular skeleton
- Constraints can be in the CNS or CYANA format
via command line and GUI (using TK and Pmw)

This plugin actually works quite well, although :
- Architecture of the core the plugin is under revamping to ease the communication with the GUI and the CLI (CLI and core are completeley mixed)
- Need to create a better config initialisation
- Need to finish the GUI

Installation :
- copy the files into a single directory anywhere on your disk
- edit .pymolrc in your home directory and add "run /path/to/files/pyNMR.py"
- edit variable "installDir" in two files and set it to the install directory (Hopefully this should not be needed in the future)

Start plugin :
It is not yet a standard pymol plugin, so you have to type in the command line : pyNMR=NMRApplication()

Usage :
The GUI is quite straightforward for NMR people I think. The listbox behaviour is quite eratic for now, use it just before the display buttons.
The CLI is more complicated for now, I have some work to do with that.

Possible future features :
Display of angular constraint
